## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to:
1. Extract data from a public website (e.g., news articles, product listings).
2. Encrypt the extracted data using a basic encryption technique (e.g., AES encryption).
3. Integrate a public API (e.g., weather API, cryptocurrency data) to fetch additional information related to the scraped data.
4. Use version control through Git and GitHub to manage code and collaborate.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Requests (for API integration)
- PyCryptodome (for encryption)
- Git (for version control)
